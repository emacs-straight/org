# Remember that we only export the first entry from this file
# into https://orgmode.org/Changes.html
# This means that links pointing to earlier changelog entries
# will be broken.

* Version 10.0 (not released yet)

** Important announcements and breaking changes

# Here, we list the *most important* changes and changes that _likely_
# require user action for most Org mode users.
# Sorted from most important to least important.

** New features

# We list the most important features, and the features that may
# require user action to be used.

** New and changed options

# Changes dealing with changing default values of customizations,
# adding new customizations, or changing the interpretation of the
# existing customizations.

** New functions and changes in function arguments

# This also includes changes in function behavior from Elisp perspective.

*** New function ~org-format-percent-cookie~

Given the completed and total number of tasks, format the percent
cookie =[N%]=.

** Removed or renamed functions and variables

** Miscellaneous

*** The percent cookie is now non-zero when any sub-task is complete

With a large number of tasks (N > 100) the percent cookie previously
showed =0%= when a non-zero amount have been completed, e.g. 1/101.
Those cases now show =1%= instead.  The same is true for the checkbox
status summary type =X%= when defining columns for column view.

* Version 9.8
** Important announcements and breaking changes

# Here, we list the *most important* changes and changes that _likely_
# require user action for most Org mode users.
# Sorted from most important to least important.

*** You may need to update =org-protocol= bookmarklets for browsers

In Firefox 133 and Firefox 128.5 ESR, the previously suggested
JavaScript bookmarklets replace the current page with the bookmarklet URL
text.  We have updated the manual with new bookmarklets that do not
have this problem.

The new bookmarklets have ~void(0);~ appended at the end, so that they
do not return anything.

Example:

#+begin_example
javascript:location.href='org-protocol://store-link?url='+
      encodeURIComponent(location.href);void(0);
#+end_example

*** =C-c C-x C-v= command toggling inline image display has been reworked

Previously, =C-c C-x C-v= always toggled image display in the whole
buffer (or narrowed part of the buffer).  With prefix argument, it
also forced displaying image links with description.

Now, =C-c C-x C-v= is bound to a new command ~org-link-preview~, which
uses different defaults:

1. When the region is active, images in the region are previewed

2. Otherwise, if there is an image at point, it is toggled.  If there
   is no image at point, images in the current entry are previewed

3. With the =C-u= argument, image previews in the active region or at
   point are cleared instead

4. The =C-u C-u= argument unconditionally shows all images in the
   accessible portion of the buffer

5. The =C-u C-u C-u= argument unconditionally clears all images in the
   accessible portion of the buffer

6. Displaying images over links with description can be forced using
   numeric argument:
   - ~C-u 1~ for toggling all images at point/current entry
   - ~C-u 11~ for toggling all images in buffer

(The first five of these prefix argument behaviors are the same as that of
the ~org-latex-preview~ command.)

In addition to images, ~org-link-preview~ can also be used to preview
Org links of all types for which preview behavior is defined, see
[[#link-preview][previews for arbitrary link types]].
